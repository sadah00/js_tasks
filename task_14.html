To disconnect VS Code from the deleted repository and connect to a new one:

1. **Remove the old Git remote:**
    - Open the terminal in VS Code.
    - Run:
      ```
      git remote remove origin
      ```

2. **Connect to your new repository:**
    - Create a new repository on GitHub.
    - Copy the repository URL.
    - Run:
      ```
      git remote add origin <new-repo-url>
      ```

3. **Push your code to the new repository:**
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    (Replace `main` with your branch name if different.)

Now VS Code is connected to your new repository.
